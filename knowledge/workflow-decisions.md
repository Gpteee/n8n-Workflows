# Workflow Design Decisions

This file documents WHY certain architectural decisions were made in workflows.

## Decision Format
```
### [Workflow Name] - [Decision Date]
**Decision**: [What was decided]
**Reasoning**: [Why this approach was chosen]
**Alternatives Considered**: [What else was evaluated]
**Outcome**: [Results of this decision]
```

### Automated Project Documentation Workflow - 2025-10-22
**Decision**: Use Claude AI for documentation generation instead of template-based approach
**Reasoning**: AI can analyze project context and generate more relevant, comprehensive documentation that adapts to different tech stacks and project types
**Alternatives Considered**: Static templates, rule-based generation, other AI models
**Outcome**: More intelligent, context-aware documentation that requires minimal manual customization

### Multi-Repository Processing Architecture - 2025-10-22
**Decision**: Process repositories in batches using splitInBatches nodes
**Reasoning**: Enables handling multiple repositories efficiently while maintaining workflow readability and allowing for parallel processing optimization
**Alternatives Considered**: Single repository per workflow execution, parallel processing with multiple workflow instances
**Outcome**: Scalable architecture that can handle projects with multiple repositories without performance degradation

### Database Integration Strategy - 2025-10-22
**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL for logging and Redis for caching
**Reasoning**: PostgreSQL provides robust analytics and audit capabilities, while Redis offers fast caching for frequently accessed data
**Alternatives Considered**: Single database solution, file-based logging, cloud database services
**Outcome**: Optimal performance and comprehensive tracking capabilities

### Documentation Commit Strategy - 2025-10-22
**Decision**: Commit documentation directly to repository docs/ folder
**Reasoning**: Keeps documentation close to code, enables version control, and integrates with existing development workflows
**Alternatives Considered**: Separate documentation repository, wiki systems, external documentation platforms
**Outcome**: Documentation stays synchronized with code changes and is easily discoverable by developers
