### Project Documentation Automation - 2025-10-22

**Decision**: Dual-trigger system (scheduled + webhook) with Claude AI integration for automated documentation generation

**Reasoning**: 
- **Scheduled execution**: Ensures documentation stays current even without explicit triggers (every 6 hours catches daily development cycles)
- **Webhook support**: Enables on-demand updates and GitHub integration for immediate doc updates on commits
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Latest model provides best code understanding and technical writing quality
- **Multi-storage**: GitHub for source control, Supabase for history/audit trail
- **Modular analysis**: Separate nodes for commits, files, and structure enable parallel execution and easier debugging

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Cron-only trigger**: Rejected - lacks real-time responsiveness for critical updates
2. **OpenAI GPT-4**: Rejected - Claude shows better performance for technical documentation and longer context windows
3. **Single JSON file output**: Rejected - multiple files (README, ARCHITECTURE, CHANGELOG) provide better organization
4. **Local file storage**: Rejected - GitHub integration ensures version control and Supabase enables analytics

**Outcome**: 
- Workflow can handle both automated and manual documentation updates
- Supports multi-repo projects through configurable repository array
- Generates comprehensive documentation (README, ARCHITECTURE, CHANGELOG)
- Maintains history for rollback and analysis
- Integrates seamlessly with existing development workflow (GitHub-centric)
